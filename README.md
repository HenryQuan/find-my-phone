# Find my phone
Just today my friend was finding his iPhone and the he used his Apple Watch to ring his phone. I hope I could also do something similar but I dont have an Apple Watch and I use Android. Then, I thought maybe I could make one not Apple Watch but something that could ring any android devices as long as you have Bluetooth.
### Arduino + Bluetooth + Android Studio ?
The idea is the to use arduino and a bluetooth component to send signals? to my android phone through an app. The app will keep running in the background and will watch for bluetooth signals? and ring the default alarm when received from arduino. If it works, I could make a container (3D printing maybe) to make it looks better.
##### This is just an idea
I dont know if I could do this since it evolves hardwares and softwares at the same time and it is something new for me but it is always good to challenge myself.
